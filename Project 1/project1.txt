1. djikstra.py prints out a path using matrix index values as coordinates
2. apriltag localization implements the coordinates into planning and executing a path for the robot:
a. set robot location (global coordinate) to (3,1)
b. calculate cell length in unit of measurement used by april tags
c. create a trajectory which moves the robot according to its location a specific april tag 
(april tag reference changed every cell move or once needed)
d. use pid to adjust robot to april tag location, update robot coordinate, signaling robot to move on to next cell
e. implement error checking to allow slight error when traveling between cells and adjusting movement based on robot
cell location

note: implement straffing and don't include angles when moving

code implementation:

- use a do while loop to run a specific instruction until the error is minimized
- scan for april tag, get robot location
- code traj using constant velocity & distance traveled to calculate time needed to switch
between different cells
- scan for april tag, get robot location again, repeat above step until satisfied
- update robot cell location
- move onto next step in the trajectory
